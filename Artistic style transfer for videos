Abstract. In the past, manually re-drawing an image in a certain artistic style required a professional artist and a long time. Doing this for a
video sequence single-handed was beyond imagination. Nowadays computers provide new possibilities. We present an approach that transfers
the style from one image (for example, a painting) to a whole video sequence. We make use of recent advances in style transfer in still images
and propose new initializations and loss functions applicable to videos.
This allows us to generate consistent and stable stylized video sequences,
even in cases with large motion and strong occlusion. We show that
the proposed method clearly outperforms simpler baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively
